# Issue #89: Fix Architecture Mismatch - Universal Binary Builds

**Issue Link**: https://github.com/jsonify/vox/issues/89

## Problem Analysis

The core issue is that our CI/CD workflows are bypassing the existing `build.sh` script that properly creates universal binaries, instead using simple `swift build` commands that only build for the current runner's architecture.

### Current State
- ✅ **Working**: `build.sh` script creates proper universal binaries
- ❌ **Broken**: CI/CD workflows use `swift build -c release` directly
- ❌ **Result**: Users get "bad CPU type in executable" errors

### Root Cause
Looking at the workflows:

**CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml:228-235)**:
```yaml
- name: Build release configuration
  run: |
    swift build -c release --verbose 2>&1 | tee release-build.log
```

**Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml:170-173)**:
```yaml
- name: Build release binary
  run: |
    swift build -c release --verbose
```

Both workflows should be using `./build.sh` instead.

### Existing Build Script Analysis
The `build.sh` script already has everything we need:
- ✅ Builds for both `arm64` and `x86_64` architectures
- ✅ Creates universal binaries with `lipo`
- ✅ Validates binary functionality
- ✅ Generates checksums
- ✅ Creates distribution packages
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update CI Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

1. **Replace build step** (lines 228-235):
   - From: `swift build -c release --verbose`
   - To: `./build.sh`

2. **Update artifact verification** (lines 344-358):
   - Check for universal binary in `dist/vox`
   - Validate both architectures are present

3. **Add universal binary validation**:
   - Use `lipo -info` to verify architectures
   - Test binary functionality

### Phase 2: Update Release Workflow
**File**: `.github/workflows/release.yml`

1. **Replace build step** (lines 170-198):
   - From: `swift build -c release --verbose`
   - To: `./build.sh`

2. **Update binary location**:
   - From: `find .build -name "vox" -type f -path "*/release/*"`
   - To: `dist/vox` (created by build.sh)

3. **Update packaging** (lines 200-214):
   - Remove manual packaging steps
   - Use packages created by `build.sh`

### Phase 3: Enhance Build Script for CI
**File**: `build.sh`

Add CI-friendly enhancements:
- `--ci` flag for CI-optimized builds
- `--skip-validation` flag for environments where testing may fail
- Better error messages for CI debugging

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates
**File**: `CLAUDE.md`

Update build instructions to emphasize universal binary process.

## Technical Implementation Details

### CI Workflow Changes
Replace the current build validation job's build step:

```yaml
# OLD
- name: Build release configuration
  run: |
    swift build -c release --verbose 2>&1 | tee release-build.log

# NEW
- name: Build universal binary
  run: |
    echo "=== Building Universal Binary ==="
    ./build.sh
    echo "=== Universal Binary Build Complete ==="
```

### Release Workflow Changes
Replace the current release build step:

```yaml
# OLD
- name: Build release binary
  run: |
    swift build -c release --verbose
    BINARY_PATH=$(find .build -name "vox" -type f -path "*/release/*" | head -1)
    # ... manual binary handling

# NEW
- name: Build universal binary
  run: |
    echo "=== Building Universal Binary for Release ==="
    ./build.sh
    echo "=== Universal Binary Ready ==="
```

### Validation Steps
Add universal binary validation:

```yaml
- name: Validate universal binary
  run: |
    echo "=== Validating Universal Binary ==="
    if [ -f "dist/vox" ]; then
      echo "✅ Universal binary exists"
      file dist/vox
      lipo -info dist/vox
      
      # Verify both architectures are present
      if lipo -info dist/vox | grep -q "arm64" && lipo -info dist/vox | grep -q "x86_64"; then
        echo "✅ Both ARM64 and x86_64 architectures confirmed"
      else
        echo "❌ Missing required architectures"
        exit 1
      fi
    else
      echo "❌ Universal binary not found at dist/vox"
      exit 1
    fi
```

## Testing Strategy

1. **Pre-Implementation Testing**:
   - Verify `build.sh` works in local environment
   - Test that universal binaries work on both architectures

2. **Post-Implementation Testing**:
   - Check CI builds produce universal binaries
   - Verify release artifacts work on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
   - Test installation process

## Success Criteria

- [ ] CI builds produce universal binaries containing both ARM64 and x86_64
- [ ] Release artifacts work on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs  
- [ ] Universal binary validation passes in CI
- [ ] No "bad CPU type" errors for supported architectures
- [ ] Build process remains reliable and maintainable

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: The existing `build.sh` script is already working and well-tested. We're just integrating it into CI/CD instead of bypassing it.

**Mitigation**: Keep the current workflows as backups until the new approach is proven to work.

## Implementation Results

1. **✅ Created comprehensive analysis document** - This document
2. **✅ Updated CI workflow** - Now uses `./build.sh` instead of `swift build`
3. **✅ Updated release workflow** - Now creates universal binaries with proper validation
4. **✅ Enhanced build.sh script** - Added CI-friendly flags and improved error handling
5. **✅ Added universal binary validation** - Both workflows now verify ARM64 and x86_64 architectures
6. **✅ Updated documentation** - CLAUDE.md reflects new universal binary process
7. **✅ Local testing completed** - Verified build script works in both normal and CI modes

### Key Changes Made

**CI Workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml)**:
- Replaced `swift build -c release` with `./build.sh`
- Added universal binary validation steps
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Set `SKIP_PACKAGING=true` for CI efficiency

**Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)**:
- Replaced manual build steps with `./build.sh`
- Added `BUILD_VERSION` environment variable for proper versioning
- Enhanced distribution package verification
- Added both ARM64 and x86_64 architecture validation

**Build Script (build.sh)**:
- Added CI mode detection (`CI=true` or `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`)
- Added environment variables: `CI_MODE`, `SKIP_TESTS`, `SKIP_PACKAGING`, `SKIP_VALIDATION`, `BUILD_VERSION`
- Enhanced error handling for CI environments
- Improved logging and validation feedback

**Documentation (CLAUDE.md)**:
