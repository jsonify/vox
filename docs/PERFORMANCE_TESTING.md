## Running Performance Tests

### 1. Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run all performance tests
swift test --filter Performance

# Run specific enhanced performance tests
swift test --filter EnhancedPerformanceTests

# Run architecture comparison tests
swift test --filter ArchitectureComparisonTests

# Run performance regression tests
swift test --filter PerformanceRegressionTests
```

### 2. Standalone Performance Validation

```bash
# Build the performance validator
swift build

# Run performance validation (planned)
swift run vox-performance

# Or use the validator directly in code
let validator = PerformanceValidator()
let summary = validator.runComprehensiveValidation()
let report = validator.generatePerformanceReport(summary)
```

### 3. CI/CD Integration

The performance validator can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:

```bash
# Exit code 0 = all tests passed
# Exit code 1 = some tests failed
swift run vox-performance || exit 1
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Run performance tests before major changes**:
   ```bash
   swift test --filter PerformanceRegressionTests
   ```

2. **Validate against CLAUDE.md targets**:
   ```bash
   swift test --filter EnhancedPerformanceTests.testCLAUDEMDPerformanceTargets
   ```

3. **Monitor memory usage during development**:
   ```bash
   swift test --filter EnhancedPerformanceTests.testComprehensiveMemoryProfiling
   ```

### For CI/CD

1. **Include performance validation in build pipeline**
2. **Set up baseline management for regression detection**
3. **Configure performance reports for analysis**
4. **Use exit codes for build status determination**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test timeouts**: Increase timeout values for large file tests
2. **Memory pressure**: Reduce concurrent test execution
3. **Architecture detection**: Ensure proper platform optimization setup
4. **File generation failures**: Check disk space and permissions

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check system information
swift run vox --help

# Validate platform optimizer
swift test --filter OptimizedPerformanceTests.testPlatformDetection

# Check memory manager
swift test --filter OptimizedPerformanceTests.testMemoryPoolPerformance
```
