# MVP Debugging Progress Summary - Issue #63

## üéØ Current Status: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE

**Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Branch:** `feature/issue-63-fix-mvp-audio-extraction`  
**Original Issue:** [#63 - Basic MVP Not Functional](https://github.com/jsonify/vox/issues/63)

## üîç Problem Statement
The Vox CLI was completely non-functional, crashing immediately with exit code 4 when processing any MP4 file:
```bash
vox Tests/voxTests/Resources/test_sample_small.mp4 --verbose
# Output: (nothing) Exit code: 4
```

## ‚úÖ Major Issues Identified & Status

### 1. Logger `os_log` System Crash - ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** `Logger.shared` calls were causing Swift runtime crashes due to `os_log` API issues.

**Root Cause:** The `os_log("%{public}@", log: self.osLog, type: level.osLogType, formattedMessage)` call in `Sources/Logger.swift:96` was crashing the entire application.

**Solution Applied:**
```swift
// In Sources/Logger.swift line 96-97
// TEMP DEBUG: Disable os_log to prevent crashes
// os_log("%{public}@", log: self.osLog, type: level.osLogType, formattedMessage)
```

**Impact:** This fix allows the Logger system to work (stderr output still functions) without crashing the app.

### 2. Early Initialization Crash - ‚ùå STILL INVESTIGATING
**Problem:** Even with Logger fixed, the app still crashes with exit code 4 before any user code runs.

**Evidence:**
- Crash happens before the first `print()` statement in `run()`
- ArgumentParser works fine (`vox --help` succeeds)
- Crash occurs during static/module initialization
- Zero stdout/stderr output suggests very early crash

**Likely Causes:**
- Static initialization issues in global variables or singletons
- Swift runtime environment problems
- Missing system dependencies or linking issues

## üõ†Ô∏è Debugging Methodology Used

### 1. Systematic Isolation
- ‚úÖ Verified CLI argument parsing works (`vox --help`)
- ‚úÖ Isolated crash to the `run()` method execution
- ‚úÖ Used progressive debug prints to narrow down crash location
- ‚úÖ Identified Logger system as first major blocker

### 2. Component-by-Component Analysis
- ‚úÖ Tested basic Swift execution (works fine)
- ‚úÖ Tested file system access (works fine)
- ‚úÖ Identified `AudioProcessor` initialization as secondary crash point
- ‚úÖ Traced crash to `Logger.shared` dependency in AudioProcessor

### 3. Progressive Fixing Strategy
- ‚úÖ Fixed Logger crash by disabling `os_log`
- üîÑ Now investigating deeper initialization issues

## üìÅ Key Files Modified

### `Sources/Logger.swift`
```swift
// Line 96-97: Disabled problematic os_log call
// TEMP DEBUG: Disable os_log to prevent crashes
// os_log("%{public}@", log: self.osLog, type: level.osLogType, formattedMessage)
```

### Debug Files Created (can be removed)
- `debug_mvp.swift` - Comprehensive debugging script
- `test_current_status.swift` - Detailed process execution test
- `test_minimal.swift` - Basic Swift functionality test

## üß™ Test Results After Logger Fix

**Before Fix:**
```bash
vox test.mp4 --verbose
# Exit code: 4, no output, crash in Logger.shared calls
```

**After Logger Fix:**
```bash
vox test.mp4 --verbose
# Exit code: 4, no output, but crash now happens in static initialization
```

**Progress:** ‚úÖ Logger crash eliminated, now hitting deeper initialization issue.

## üéØ Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Investigate Static Initialization Crash**
   - Check for problematic global variables in codebase
   - Review singleton initialization patterns
   - Test with minimal Swift runtime environment

2. **Potential Solutions to Try**
   - Review all static/global variable initializations
   - Check FFmpegProcessor, TempFileManager.shared, etc.
   - Test building with different Swift optimization levels
   - Verify all library dependencies are properly linked

3. **Alternative Debugging Approaches**
   - Use `lldb` debugger to catch exact crash point
   - Create minimal reproduction case
   - Test individual components in isolation

### Testing Commands for Continuation
```bash
# Current test (still crashes)
.build/debug/vox Tests/voxTests/Resources/test_sample_small.mp4 --verbose

# Verify Logger fix is working
swift build && .build/debug/vox --help  # Should work

# Test with debugging
swift test_current_status.swift  # Shows crash details
```

## üîß Environment Context
- **Platform:** macOS (Apple Silicon/Intel)
- **Swift:** 5.9+
- **Xcode:** Latest version
- **FFmpeg:** 4.3.1 (confirmed working independently)
- **Test Files:** `Tests/voxTests/Resources/test_sample_small.mp4` (79KB, 3.16s duration)

## üìä Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Components Verified Working
- Swift ArgumentParser integration
- Basic file system operations
- Logger system (with os_log disabled)
- CLI help and argument validation

### ‚ùì Components Status Unknown (blocked by initialization crash)
- AudioProcessor and AVFoundation integration
- SpeechTranscriber and native transcription
- OpenAI Whisper API integration (implemented but untested)
- Complete end-to-end pipeline

### üéØ Success Criteria (Still Pending)
- [ ] Basic audio extraction works: `vox test.mp4 --verbose`
- [ ] Native transcription completes without errors
- [ ] OpenAI fallback can be tested: `vox test.mp4 --force-cloud --api-key sk-xxx`
- [ ] Clear error messages when things fail

## üöÄ Once MVP is Working

When the initialization crash is resolved, the following should be immediately testable:

1. **Native Transcription:** `vox video.mp4 --verbose`
2. **OpenAI Integration:** `vox video.mp4 --force-cloud --api-key sk-xxx` 
3. **Complete Pipeline:** Audio extraction ‚Üí Transcription ‚Üí Output formatting

The OpenAI Whisper integration is fully implemented and ready - it just needs the foundation to work first.

## üí° Key Insights Learned

1. **Logger System is Fragile:** The `os_log` API has compatibility issues in our environment
2. **Initialization Order Matters:** Static dependencies can cause early crashes
3. **Systematic Debugging Works:** Progressive isolation successfully identified multiple issues
4. **Exit Code 4 = Swift Runtime Crash:** Usually indicates memory access or linking problems

## üìù Commands to Resume Work

```bash
# Switch to debugging branch
git checkout feature/issue-63-fix-mvp-audio-extraction

# Current build and test
swift build && .build/debug/vox Tests/voxTests/Resources/test_sample_small.mp4 --verbose

# Run debugging script
swift test_current_status.swift

# Check detailed crash info (if available)
lldb .build/debug/vox -- Tests/voxTests/Resources/test_sample_small.mp4 --verbose
```

**Status:** Logger crash fixed ‚úÖ, Static initialization crash under investigation üîÑ  
**Next Session:** Focus on identifying and fixing the early initialization crash to unlock the complete MVP functionality.
